                <h1>Cancer: Causes, Symptoms, and Diagnosis</h1>
                <p>Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in breast tissue, primarily in the milk ducts or lobules. It occurs when cells in the breast grow uncontrollably and can metastasize to other parts of the body. It can be classified into various types, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Hormonal receptors (such as estrogen/progesterone) or proteins like HER2 can further classify the cancer, influencing treatment options.</p>

                <h2>More Information</h2>
                <p>Women over 40 are the most vulnerable, but cases can also occur in younger women, particularly with early menstruation, late menopause, or hormone replacement therapy use. A family history of breast cancer, especially genetic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, increases the risk significantly. Lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption, obesity, and exposure to radiation are also contributing factors. Men can develop breast cancer too, though it's rare.

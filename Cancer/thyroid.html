                <h1>Thyroid Cancer: Causes, Symptoms, and Diagnosis</h1>
                <p>Thyroid cancer occurs in the thyroid gland, located at the base of the neck. It may present as a lump or swelling in the thyroid area. The primary types include papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid cancers. Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common, while anaplastic is the rarest and most aggressive. Risk factors include radiation exposure, family history, and certain genetic conditions. Treatment options vary based on cancer type and stage.</p>
